# 🗺️ Real-Time Location Tracking Setup Guide

## 🚀 Enable Real User Location Tracking

Your API is now configured for **LIVE location tracking**! Here's what you need to set up:

## 📋 Required API Keys

Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
# Google Maps API (Required for location data)
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_maps_api_key_here
```

## 🔑 How to Get API Keys

### 1. Google Maps API Key (REQUIRED)
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing
3. Enable these APIs:
   - Places API
   - Directions API
   - Roads API
   - Distance Matrix API
4. Create credentials → API Key
5. Copy the key to your `.env` file


## 🧪 Test Real Location Tracking

### 1. Track Your Location
```http
POST http://localhost:3000/api/transportation/location/track
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "latitude": 40.7589,
  "longitude": -73.9851,
  "accuracy": 10
}
```

### 2. Get Real-Time Data for Your Location
```http
GET http://localhost:3000/api/transportation/location/realtime?latitude=40.7589&longitude=-73.9851&radius=1000&transportType=all
```

### 3. Find Nearby Transportation
```http
GET http://localhost:3000/api/transportation/location/nearby?latitude=40.7589&longitude=-73.9851&radius=500&transportType=bus
```

## 🌍 Test Different Locations

### New York City
```http
GET http://localhost:3000/api/transportation/location/realtime?latitude=40.7589&longitude=-73.9851&radius=1000
```

### London
```http
GET http://localhost:3000/api/transportation/location/realtime?latitude=51.5074&longitude=-0.1278&radius=1000
```

### Tokyo
```http
GET http://localhost:3000/api/transportation/location/realtime?latitude=35.6762&longitude=139.6503&radius=1000
```

## 🎯 What You'll Get

With real location tracking, you'll get:

✅ **Real nearby transit stations** from Google Places API
✅ **Actual walking distances** and times
✅ **Real traffic conditions** in your area
✅ **Actual bus/metro schedules** and delays
✅ **Location-based alerts** and notifications

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Google Maps API is REQUIRED** - Without it, location tracking won't work
2. **API costs money** - Google Maps has usage limits and charges
3. **Rate limits apply** - Don't make too many requests too quickly
4. **Location accuracy** - The more accurate your coordinates, the better results

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "API key not found" error
- Make sure your `.env` file has the correct API key
- Restart your server after adding the key

### "Quota exceeded" error
- You've hit the API usage limit
- Check your Google Cloud Console billing

### "No results found"
- Try a different location
- Increase the radius parameter
- Check if the location has public transit

## 🎉 You're Ready!

Once you add the Google Maps API key, your location tracking will work with **real data** from your actual location!

**Test it now with your real coordinates!** 🗺️
