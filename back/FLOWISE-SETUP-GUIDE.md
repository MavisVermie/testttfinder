## Flowise Agent Configuration

### Agent 1: Personalized Recommendations

Your Flowise agent should be configured to handle travel recommendations. Here's the recommended setup:

#### Input Parameters
The agent should accept these parameters:
- `location`: Destination location (e.g., "Paris, France")
- `interests`: Array of interests (e.g., ["culture", "food", "art"])
- `budget`: Budget level ("low", "medium", "high", "luxury")
- `duration`: Trip duration (e.g., "1 week", "weekend")
- `travelStyle`: Travel style (e.g., "tourist", "backpacker", "family")

#### Expected Output Format
The agent should return structured JSON with:

```json
{
  "attractions": [
    {
      "name": "Attraction Name",
      "type": "museum|restaurant|activity|landmark|entertainment",

## Testing Your Setup

### 1. Test Environment Variables

Create a test file `test-env.js`:

```javascript
require('dotenv').config();

console.log('Environment Variables:');
console.log('FLOWISE_API_URL:', process.env.FLOWISE_API_URL);
console.log('FLOWISE_API_KEY:', process.env.FLOWISE_API_KEY ? 'Set' : 'Not Set');
console.log('PORT:', process.env.PORT);
```

Run it with: `node test-env.js`

### 2. Test Flowise Connection

Use the provided `test-flowise-integration.js` file:

```bash
node test-flowise-integration.js
```

### 3. Test API Endpoints

Once your environment is set up, test the API:

```bash
# Test health check
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/recommendations/health" -Method GET

# Test interests endpoint
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/recommendations/interests" -Method GET

# Test recommendations (replace with your actual chatflow ID)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:3000/api/recommendations/test" -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"chatflowId": "32547d3e-ba39-4604-a904-da0c516e17b1"}'
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'filePath')"**
   - This usually means there's a misconfigured node in your Flowise flow
   - Check for any file-related nodes that might be missing configuration
   - Ensure all nodes are properly connected

2. **"API Key not configured"**
   - Make sure your `.env` file is in the project root
   - Verify the API key is correct
   - Restart the server after adding environment variables

3. **"Chatflow not found"**
   - Verify the chatflow ID is correct
   - Make sure the chatflow is published and active
   - Check if you have access to the chatflow

4. **Timeout errors**
   - Increase the timeout in the service configuration
   - Check if your Flowise instance is responsive
   - Verify your internet connection

### Debug Steps

1. **Check Flowise Flow Status**
   - Log into Flowise
   - Verify your flow is published and active
   - Test the flow directly in Flowise interface

2. **Test with Simple Messages**
   - Start with basic text input
   - Gradually add complexity
   - Check Flowise logs for errors

3. **Verify API Configuration**
   - Check your API key permissions
   - Verify the API URL is correct
   - Test with Flowise's built-in API tester

## Next Steps

1. **Set up your environment variables** in the `.env` file
2. **Configure your Flowise agent** with the recommended prompt template
3. **Test the integration** using the provided test scripts
4. **Deploy and use** the API in your application

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the Flowise documentation
2. Verify your agent configuration
3. Test with simple inputs first
4. Check the server logs for detailed error messages

The API is now ready to use once your Flowise agent is properly configured!
